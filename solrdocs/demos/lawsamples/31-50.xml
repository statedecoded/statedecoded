At any time a custodian may, without court order, transfer all or part of the custodial property to a qualified minor's trust. Such a transfer terminates the custodianship to the extent of the custodial property transferred.

On petition of an interested person or the minor if the minor has attained the age of fourteen years, the court may order the custodian to deliver or pay to the minor or expend for the minor's benefit so much of the custodial property as the court considers advisable for the use and benefit of the minor.

A delivery, payment or expenditure under this section is in addition to, not in substitution for, and does not affect any obligation of a person to support the minor.</text><structure><unit label="title" identifier="31" level="1">Guardian and Ward</unit><unit label="chapter" identifier="6" level="2">Virginia Uniform Transfers to Minors Act</unit></structure></law>
