The State Decoded
=================

A free, open source, PHP- and MySQL-based application to parse and display laws. This project is currently in beta testing [as a Virginia implementation](http://vacode.org/) and in alpha testing [as a Florida implementation](http://www.sunshinestatutes.com/).

#### Notes
This is a *pre-1.0 release*, which is to say that it is an incompete product. A capable PHP developer who is familiar and comfortable with her state legal code should be able to wrangle their laws into this release with a few hours’ work. All others should wait for v1.0.

See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/statedecoded/statedecoded/wiki/Installation-Instructions) for details.

The State Decoded benefits from [APC](http://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php), which accelerates substantially its operations. It is not required, however. Likewise, it also benefits from [mod_pagespeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/mod) to streamline HTML and JavaScript, which are produced by The State Decoded without formatting that is pleasing to the eye or optimization of execution by the client.
