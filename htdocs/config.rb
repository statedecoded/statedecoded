# DO NOT DELETE - This is used for CodeKit to compile Sass for non asset pipeline projects, like this one.
# Require any additional compass plugins here.

# Set this to the root of your project when deployed:
http_path = "/"
css_dir = "static/css"
sass_dir = "static/scss"
images_dir = "static/images/"
javascripts_dir = "static/js"
fonts_dir ="static/fonts"

output_style = :nested
environment = :development

# To enable relative paths to assets via compass helper functions. Uncomment:
# relative_assets = true

# To disable debugging comments that display the original location of your selectors. Uncomment:
# line_comments = false
color_output = false


# If you prefer the indented syntax, you might want to regenerate this
# project again passing --syntax sass, or you can uncomment this:
# preferred_syntax = :sass
# and then run:
# sass-convert -R --from scss --to sass sass scss && rm -rf sass && mv scss sass
