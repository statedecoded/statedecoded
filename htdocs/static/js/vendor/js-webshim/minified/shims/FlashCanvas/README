FlashCanvas
===========

An implementation of the HTML5 Canvas API for Internet Explorer.


Description
-----------

FlashCanvas is a JavaScript library which adds the HTML5 Canvas support
to Internet Explorer. It renders shapes and images via Flash drawing
API, and in many cases, runs faster than other similar libraries which
use VML or Silverlight.


Requirements
------------

 * Microsoft Internet Explorer
 * Adobe Flash Player 9 or later


Usage
-----

FlashCanvas consists of JavaScript, Flash and PHP files:

 * flashcanvas.js
 * flashcanvas.swf
 * canvas2png.js (helps you to save a canvas image)
 * proxy.php     (used to load a file from other domain)
 * save.php      (used to save a canvas image)

These files can be found in the bin directory in this distribution
package. To install FlashCanvas, copy these files into some directory on
a Web server, and then add the following HTML code between <head> and
</head> tags on your web page.

    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/flashcanvas.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->

That's all you have to do in most cases. For more details, please read
the online manual at the project page.
