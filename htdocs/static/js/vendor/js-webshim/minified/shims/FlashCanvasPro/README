FlashCanvas Pro
===============

An implementation of the HTML5 Canvas API for Internet Explorer.


Description
-----------

FlashCanvas is a JavaScript library which adds the HTML5 Canvas support
to Internet Explorer. It renders shapes and images via Flash drawing
API, and in many cases, runs faster than other similar libraries which
use VML or Silverlight.

FlashCanvas Pro is a professional edition of FlashCanvas. It supports
almost all Canvas APIs including text, shadow and pixel manipulation.
Moreover, it utilizes Flash Player 10 features if available, that
provides better performance and compatibility.


Requirements
------------

 * Microsoft Internet Explorer
 * Adobe Flash Player 9 or later


Usage
-----

FlashCanvas Pro consists of JavaScript, Flash and PHP files:

 * flashcanvas.js
 * flash9canvas.swf
 * flash10canvas.swf
 * canvas2png.js (helps you to save a canvas image)
 * proxy.php     (used to load a file from other domain)
 * save.php      (used to save a canvas image)

These files can be found in the bin directory in this distribution
package. To install FlashCanvas Pro, copy these files into some
directory on a Web server, and then add the following HTML code between
<head> and </head> tags on your web page.

    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/flashcanvas.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->

That's all you have to do in most cases. For more details, please read
the online manual at the project page.
